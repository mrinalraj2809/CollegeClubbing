# CollegeClubbing
## Introduction:
An Android-based college clubbing platform for students, teachers and college administration.<br/>
This objective is to completely digitalize the College notice board and easy access for the students to 
know about the college events and the pending quiz or assignment dates.

## Motivation: 
Almost in every college releases a circular which they put up on the notice board. <br/> This is a very traditional way and time taking for the information to reach every student. <br/>So we came with the idea of building a platform where we can club students and college administration where administrator can create an notice indicating the time, date and the purpose which will be sent to each students instantaneously and an reminder will be created.

## Expected Outcomes:
